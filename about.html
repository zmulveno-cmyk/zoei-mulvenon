    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a third-year Media Arts and Sciences major at Arizona State University, 
      passionate about combining creativity and technology. I have experience in design, 
      digital media, and web development. I enjoy creating visually engaging projects 
      using HTML, CSS, animations, and storytelling. I am proficient with tools such as 
      Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Canva, and Max 9. I continually explore 
      new software to expand my creative toolkit. My goal is to build projects that are not 
      only aesthetically striking but also user-friendly and innovative.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my technical work, I have a strong interest in philosophy and creative writing,
      which informs the way I approach storytelling, conceptual thinking, and problem-solving in 
      design. I thrive in collaborative and fast-paced environments, bringing creativity, critical
      thinking, and attention to detail to every project. I aim to create innovative, 
      user-centered work that combines art, technology, writing, and thoughtful design.
